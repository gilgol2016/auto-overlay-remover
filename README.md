# auto-overlay-remover
Chrome extension which removes overlays automatically from your chrome browser


Automatically close overlay popup without the need to press on any button.

You have probably encountered in web sites you visit, the frustrating overlay which masks the page content with a transparent or semitransparent background and above it a registration form, sign up for newsletter, advertising of products, a survey and etc. 

Overlays are the next generation after the standard popup window, which has almost gone from our web world. Overlays are much trickier and can appear in a variety of ways like: on website on load even before you can see any content, after a delay, when you move your mouse, click on something or even more creative ways.

This extension is lightweight and will close for you most of the overlays without doing anything. There is no need to click or press anything for almost any overlay. You can add specific web sites to a white list, use different timing or more aggressive overlay cleaning.

The permission to read / write needed for saving the white list.

I hope that my extension will succeed to make your web surfing less frustrating and more pleasant.

FAQ:

Q: What is Overlay?

A: semi-transparent top layer on a website page which contains form, information or advertising that the website owner want you to pay attention. Some of them can be very annoying. Because there is no standard each developer does it as he wants. For example: Sometimes they don’t have 'X' to close it or it small and in a unexpected place. Overlays can appear at any time from the page load (and sometimes before it fully loaded). It can appear by event like pressing on a key from mouse or keyboard or by moving the mouse cursor.

Q: why did I develop it?

A: Because overlays became very common and are very frustrating and couldn't find anything that can remove or disable it well and automatically I decided to develop the "Auto Overlay Remover" extension to remove those annoying overlays automatically.

Q: Does it work everywhere?

A: "Auto Overlay Remover" removes most of the overlays but not all of them. The reason is that because there is no standard so there is hundreds of types and/or techniques for overlays to appear and work. As a result if you want to remove 100% you need to search one by one and make a workout or algorithm for each type of overlay to remove. Instead I decided to make an algorithm that will remove most of them regardless to the web site.

Q: what to do if it removes legitimate part of the site or I don't want to remove overlay in a specific site?

A: you can press on the icon of the "Auto Overlay Remover" extension and press on 'Add' button to add the current site to the white list.

Q: I still have overlay, what can I do?

A: You have another three options:

  •	Click on the icon and popup will appear and click on the button 'Run now'. It will remove it but temporarily.

  •	Go to the option page of "Auto Overlay Remover" extension and check the Aggressive search & remove it search for longer time and more depth but it may cost by more CPU usage.

  •	You can choose in options one of these options in 'Start running mode': 
  
    o	Immediately – during the page is uploading.
    
    o	After page load – almost after the (synchronous part of) page is loaded. But remember there is part of the site which is loaded asynchronous and there is no way to predict when it really will be fully uploaded.
    
    o	Delayed start - add a delay time to solve the scenario which the overlay will appear in a longer delay.
    
Q: Can I remove the white list that I created?

A: Yes you can.  In option page please check the option 'Clear white list' and click on 'Save' button, but do it with caution because it will delete all the domains that appears in the white list permanently.

Q: How can I remove a specific domain from the white list I created?

A: You can do it in that way: go to the site you want to remove and you are there press on the "Auto Overlay Remover" icon and choose remove. It will remove the domain from the white list.

Q: How can I contact with you?

A: You can mail me: removeoverlay@gmail.com
