	<p><b>Q: What is Overlay?</b><br>
		A: Semi-transparent top	layer on a website page which contains form, information or
		advertising that the website owner want you to pay attention. Some of them can be very annoying. 
		Because there is no standard each developer does it as he wants. For example: Sometimes they don’t
		have 'X' to close it or it small and in a unexpected place. Overlays	can appear at any time from 
		the page load (and sometimes before it	fully loaded). It can appear by event like pressing on a key from
		mouse or keyboard or by moving the mouse cursor.</p>
	
	<p><b>Q: why did I develop it?</b><br>
		A: Because overlays became	very common and are very frustrating and couldn't find anything that
		can remove or disable it well and automatically I decided to develop	the &quot;Auto Overlay 
		Remover&quot; extension to remove those annoying overlays automatically.</P>
	
	<P><b>Q: Does it work everywhere?</b><br>
		A: &quot;Auto Overlay Remover&quot; removes most of the overlays but not all of them. The
		reason is that because there is no standard so there is hundreds of types and/or techniques 
		for overlays to appear and work. As a result	if you want to remove 100% you need to search 
		one by one and make a workout or algorithm for each type of overlay to remove. Instead I
		decided to make an algorithm that will remove most of them regardless to the web site.</P>
	
	<P><b>Q: what to do if it removes legitimate part of the site or I don't want to remove overlay in a specific site?</b><br>
		A: you can press on the icon of the &quot;Auto Overlay Remover&quot; extension and press on
		'Add' button to add the current site to the white list.</P>
	
	<P><b>Q: The overlay still apears. What can I do?</b><br>
		A: You have three more options:
	<UL>
		<LI>Click on the icon and popup will appear and click on the button 'Run now'. It will remove it but temporarily.
		<LI>Go to the option page of &quot;Auto Overlay Remover&quot; extension and check the
			Aggressive search &amp; remove it search for longer time and more	depth but it may cost by more CPU usage.
		<LI>You can choose in options one of these options in 'Start running mode':
		<UL>
			<LI><b>Immediately</b> – during the page is uploading.
			<LI><b>After page load</b> – almost after the (synchronous part of) page is loaded. But remember	there is part 
				of the site which is loaded asynchronous and there is	no way to predict when it really will be fully uploaded.
			<LI><b>Delayed start</b> - add a delay time to solve the scenario which the overlay will appear in a longer delay.
		</UL>
	</UL>
	
	<P><b>Q: Can I remove the white list that I created?</b><br>
		A: Yes you can. In Options page, please check the option 'Clear white list' and click on 'Save' button, but do 
		it with caution because it will delete all the domains that appears in the white list permanently.</P>
	
	<P><b>Q: How can I remove a specific domain from the white list I created?</b><br>
		A: You can do it the following way: go to the site you want to remove and you are there press on the
			&quot;Auto Overlay Remover&quot; icon and choose remove. It will remove the domain from the white list.</P>
	
	<P><b>Q: How can I contact with you?</b><br>
		A: You can e-mail me: <u>removeoverlay@gmail.com</u></p>
